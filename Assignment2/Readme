-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, first go into the directory where 'pox' directory is located.
In that folder, you will find the pox.py file.
Run the command: 

1. sudo python pox.py forwarding.l2_learning openflow.discovery --eat-early-packets openflow.spanning_tree --no-flood --hold-down 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Now in the new terminal, go to the directory where code is present.
You should give no of hosts, switches as CommandLine Args.

:: The implemented topology is "MeshTopology"
Run the command:

2. sudo python topology.py "nswitches" "nhosts"
